# NB
Just a reminder for everyone that the uptime points are only distributed every six hours or so on-average, with four check-in points on-chain per day. The time at which this happens for your individual node is randomized so that there isn't chain congestion with everyone hitting the chain at the same time. 
This means that for each six-hour period, there will be one distribution of uptime points for your node SOMEWHERE in that six hour window. Hypothetically, you could have the first uptime in minute 1 of your first six-hour window and minute 360 of your second window, meaning that you could have no points showing up for almost 12 hours.
